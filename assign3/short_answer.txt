Make a Class
------------

Q1. What’s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness ensures that functions do not modify the state 
of an object when they are not supposed to. This helps prevent 
unintended side effects, makes code easier to read and debug, and allows 
for optimizations by the compiler.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. Yes, the class is const-correct. The getter function `getSpeed()` is 
marked as `const`, which ensures it does not modify the object’s state. Other
functions modify the object only when necessary, maintaining proper 
encapsulation and correctness.
